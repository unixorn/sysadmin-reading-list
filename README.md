## Languages

The **Dev** part of **DevOps** means you're going to inevitably end up writing some code. Here's a list of [free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/) for many languages.

Here are some of the scripting languages you're most likely to see in your infrastructure, with links to some good references and tutorials.

### Awk

The `awk` family (`awk`, `gawk`, `nawk` and I'm sure I've missed other implementations) of scripting languages is one of the oldest - the first version of `awk` was written in 1977, but it's on pretty much any unix (even minimal variants that might not have `perl`, `python` or `ruby`) and is still very useful.

I still use it frequently for pulling columns out of tabular output because by default (and unlike `cut` where you have to count spaces) it treats consecutive runs of whitespace characters as a delimiter, so for example you can pipe things to `awk '{print $3}'`, but it's Turing-complete - people can and have written complex programs in it.

Here are some good references to get you started:

- [Bite Size Command Line](https://wizardzines.com/comics/awk/)
- [Scripting Tutorial: Awk](https://github.com/darkn3rd/script-tut/tree/master/gen_scripts/awk)
- [Serious Shell Programming](https://freebsdfrau.gitbook.io/serious-shell-programming/basics/regex/awk)

### Bash

`bash` is objectively a terrible programming language. All variables default to being globals, there is no module system built into the language, dealing with hashes is horrible, and there are other horrors resulting from it trying to be backward compatible with `sh`.

That said, it is on every system, so every *NIX sysadmin needs to know `bash`.

Here are some useful resources to help you step up your shell scripting game:

- [The Art of the Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) - A good set of notes and tips on using the command-line that is useful when working on Linux/Unix.
- [Bash Guide For Beginners](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/) -  A practical guide which, while not always being too serious, tries to give real-life instead of theoretical examples.
- [Bash Guide](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide) - Gives examples of good practice when writing `bash` scripts. It is targeted at beginning users with no advanced knowledge.
- [Bash Pitfalls](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls) - Greg Wooledge has a great list of unpleasant surprises in `bash`.
- [Commandlinefu](https://www.commandlinefu.com/) - An extensive list of `bash` oneliners for almost every task you may need to accomplish.
- [Google's Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml) lists what Google's developers consider best practices for `bash` scripts.
- [Learning the Bash Shell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596009656.do) - It's hard to go wrong with an O'Reilly reference on anything, really.
- [Pure Bash Bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible) - A collection of pure `bash` alternatives to external processes.
- [Safe Ways to do Things in Bash](https://github.com/anordal/shellharden/blob/master/how_to_do_things_safely_in_bash.md) - An excellent set of tips from the authors of [shellharden](https://github.com/anordal/shellharden).
- [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is a lint for `bash`. It'll help you find unused variables, deprecated syntax and other things that make your `bash` scripts less stable. You can install it with `apt-get`, `brew`, `cabal`, or `yum`.
- [shellharden](https://github.com/anordal/shellharden) - is a syntax highlighter and a tool to semi-automate the rewriting of scripts to ShellCheck conformance, mainly focused on quoting.
- [zshelldoc](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zshelldoc) - Documentation generator for Bash & ZSH, with call-trees, comment extraction, etc.

Finally, remember that `bash` is not `sh`. If you're writing a script in `bash`, and testing it with `bash`, don't use `#!/bin/sh` as the shebang. Firstly, because `bash` behaves differently when called as `sh`, and secondly, not all *NIX systems (and not even all linux distributions) use `bash` as their `/bin/sh` any more.

### Powershell

Often you'll find yourself in a Windows enviroment, like it or not. These resources might help you in those cases -

- [awesome-powershell](https://github.com/janikvonrotz/awesome-powershell) - Awesome list of PowerShell resources.
- [Best Practices and Style guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle) - Unofficial recommendations for better PowerShell code.
- [Powershell Slack](http://poshcode.org) - Think of it as a virtual Powershell user's group.
- [PowerShell.org eBooks](https://leanpub.com/u/devopscollective/) - A collection of PowerShell (and other) eBooks.

### Python

Python has much better support for string manipulation and system infrastructure than Bash. In addition, there is a rich library of modules supporting various tasks you can use in your scripts that are just a `pip3 install` away.

A couple of places to go into as training are:

#### Python Books

- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), a free book that helps you automate boring and repetitive tasks with Python.

- [WSGI + Pyramid tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-pyramid-based-python-wsgi-web-applications)

### Ruby

Ruby also has a rich ecosystem of gems you can use in your programs, and like Python, much better string and data structure manipulation than Bash.

#### Ruby Books

If you're in a Ruby shop, you'll want these books:

- [Ruby Best Practices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596523015.do)

- [The Ruby Programming Language](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516178.do)

### Perl

Perl has a long history of being the system administrator's friend, bringing the best of `bash`, `sed` and `awk` together. It is also suitable for building tools for the system administrator to utilise in their work.

#### Perl Books

- [Learning Perl](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001322.do)

- [Perl tricks for system administrators](https://opensource.com/life/16/7/perl-tricks-system-administrators)

## Tools

### Cloud

#### Multi-Platform

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com) is similar to Terraform, in that you can configure infrastructure with code. Unlike Terraform, you can do this with conventional languages such as TypeScript, Python, and Go.
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is a tool that allows you to configure your infrastructure as code, just like Chef/Puppet/etc allow you to manage the configuration of individual machines as code, with all the benefits of being able to diff, code review, etc. Terraform works with (as of this edit) AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, vSphere and many other systems.

#### AWS

- [AWSCli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) provides a unified command line interface to Amazon Web Services. Wean yourself off of the webui if you want to be truly productive.
- [og-aws](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws) is an excellent resource to AWS written by and for engineers who use AWS extensively.
- [S3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) is a free command line tool and client for uploading, retrieving and managing data in Amazon S3 and other cloud storage service providers that use the S3 protocol, such as Google Cloud Storage, Backblaze B2 or DreamHost DreamObjects.

#### Azure

- [Az PowerShell Module](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell) The cross-platform (i.e. PS Core) Azure PowerShell module. Replaces the `AzureRm` module and provides a migration path from it.
- [Azure CLI 2.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) new preview CLI interface for Azure (written in python).
- [Azure Friday](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/azure-friday/) "Just two engineers, a laptop and the cloud, solving problems".
- [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) community contributed Azure Resource Manager templates for tons of things.
- [Official Azure Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular) official documentation for all Azure services.

#### Google Cloud

- [Introduction](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/) is Google's official introduction and an overview.
- [GCP for AWS professionals](https://cloud.google.com/docs/compare/aws/) lists equivalents for AWS products in GCP.
- [GCP for Azure professionals](https://cloud.google.com/docs/compare/azure/) lists equivalents for Azure products in GCP.

#### OpenStack

- [Introduction](https://www.openstack.org/software/) The OpenStack project's official introductory overview.
- [Installing](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/deployment-tools) The list of tools you should consider if you want to install and operate OpenStack yourself.

- [Stackalytics](https://www.stackalytics.io) Code contribution statistics to OpenStack and related projects.
- [SuperUser](https://superuser.openstack.org) SuperUser is an online 'publication' aggregating and editorialising content related to OpenStack and Open Infrastructure.

### Configuration Management

Quite simply, if you aren't using configuration management, you're doing it wrong.

You don't want to manually configure any servers - no matter how hard you try, they won't end up truly identical and having meat typing in commands takes far too long per server, doesn't scale, and the manual labor will discourage you from standing up new VMs for testing.

Treating your configuration as something described in text files allows you to treat it like code. You can do pull-requests, get your changes reviewed by your team, view the differences between your configuration at different times, and almost most-importantly, find out who changed the configuration, when, and if they wrote good commit messages, why.

There are several good options:

- [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) is designed to be minimal in nature, consistent, secure, and highly reliable. Owned & supported by Red Hat.
- [CFEngine](https://cfengine.com) has been in continuous development since 1993.  Unlike some of its peers on this list, it is written in C and is built with speed and scalability in mind.  It should be considered for very, very large systems and for very small (think embedded) systems.
- [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) is written in Ruby and Erlang and uses a Ruby DSL to describe system configuration.
- [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) makes it easy to automate the provisioning, configuration and ongoing management of your machines and the software running on them. Make rapid, repeatable changes and automatically enforce the consistency of systems and devices – across physical and virtual machines, on premise or in the cloud.
- [Salt](http://saltproject.io/) orchestrates the build and ongoing management of your infrastructure.

### Container Tooling

Containers package software and all its dependencies in a single package that can be run in isolation from other containers or applications running on the server, without the overhead of a full virtual machine.

#### Containerd

[Containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.

##### Installing and Learning Containerd

Follow the installation instructions for your preferred platform (Currently, only Linux and Windows are directly supported) and start learning how to use Containerd:

- [Getting started with containerd](https://containerd.io/docs/getting-started/)

On macOS, you can use [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) or [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) which both launch Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing, port forwarding, and [containerd](https://containerd.io/) installed. You can use the [lima xbar plugin](https://github.com/unixorn/lima-xbar-plugin) for a simple menubar application to control your Lima or Colima VMs.

#### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) is a tool for running and managing containers. Containers are rapidly growing in popularity for local development (as an alternative to virtual machines), and can also run software in production with tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).

##### Installing Docker

Follow the installation instructions for your preferred platform:

- [Docker CE for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- [Docker CE for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac)
  - Linux usually requires a separate installation of [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Docker CE for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

##### Learning Docker

- [The Docker Book](https://www.dockerbook.com/) - An excellent resource for getting started with Docker. This book is quick & easy to read.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable open-source container orchestration system used to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

#### Tutorials

There are many good tutorials at [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/). I recommend you start with either the [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) walkthrough since it will get you a running test cluster quickly, or enable the kubernetes cluster option in [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

VMWare sponsors a free set of online Kubernetes courses at [https://kube.academy/courses](https://kube.academy/courses).

If you want to understand everything that is involved in getting a Kubernetes cluster up and running, [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) by Kelsey Hightower is a must-read.

Have you ever wondered exactly what happens when you type something like `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --replicas=3` to make everything happen? [What happens when K8s...](https://github.com/jamiehannaford/what-happens-when-k8s/) is an in-depth guide that leads you through the full lifecycle of a request from the client to the `kubelet`, linking off to the source code where necessary to illustrate what's going on.

#### Utilities

- [k3s](https://k3s.io/) - k3s is a kubernetes distribution optimized for IOT and edge computing. It is packaged as single binaries for ARM64, ARMv7 and X86 and is ideal for a learning environment - you can set up a k3s instance in less than five minutes, and if you break it, tear it down and re-install it just as quickly.
- [krew](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/) - Makes it easy to use [kubectl plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/). `krew` helps you discover plugins, install and manage them on your machine. It is similar to tools like `apt`, `dnf` or `brew`. Today, over 70 `kubectl` plugins are available on `krew`.
- [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) - Provides the `kubectx` command, which makes it easy to switch between clusters specified in your `.kube/config`, and `kubens`, which helps you switch between Kubernetes namespaces smoothly.

### Monitoring

There are several good projects for monitoring.

- [Grafana](https://www.grafana.com) - Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data driven culture.
- [OSquery](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for Windows, linux, macOS, and FreeBSD - Use SQL queries to look into items such as installed programs, running processes, and other events for inventory and monitoring.
- [Prometheus](https://www.prometheus.io/docs) - Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company.

#### Articles/Tutorials

Help wanted.

### JSON parsing with jq

Many of the tools you're going to use have JSON output options. Trying to parse JSON with `grep` or `awk` is a world of pain, fortunately there is [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), a lightweight JSON processor you can use to slice out useful bits of the output for use in scripts similarly to how you can use `awk` or `sed` on text files.

- Adam Gordon Bell wrote a good [Introduction to JQ](https://earthly.dev/blog/jq-select/).
- There's an online playground at [https://jqplay.org/](https://jqplay.org/) you can use to experiment.

### Regular Expressions

Inevitably you're going to find yourself in a situation where you have to look at logs to see what's going wrong with a service. When it's a multi-gigabyte logfile, that can be extremely painful.

Enter regexes and the `grep` family of tools.

When you have a multi-gigabyte logfile, it's a lot less painful to look at just the entries generated by the service that you got alerted about. Even better to only look at the error messages from the service, and something as basic as `grep -i yourservice < log | grep -i errorcode` can convert a potentially multi-hour ordeal into a quick minute or two task.

- [autoregex](https://www.autoregex.xyz) - This site will let you paste a regex into it and have it translated to English, or make an English statement like "First character A, second character B, up to three B characters, then a C and end of line" and have that translated to `^A.{0,3}BC$`.
- [debuggex.com](https://www.debuggex.com/) will visualize regular expressions graphically.
- [Introducing Regular Expressions](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920012337.do) - Michael Fitzgerald's O'Reilly Book is a good place to start.
- [Regex for Noobs](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/regex-for-noobs/) - An illustrated guide to regex that aims to provide a gentle introduction for people who never have fiddled with regex, want to, but are kind of intimidated by the whole thing.
- [Regular Expressions Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023630.do)

### Sed & Awk

- [Sed and Awk Pocket Reference](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003524.do) presents a concise summary of regular expressions and pattern matching, and summaries of sed and awk and how to use them to edit files and convert data from one format to another.

### Serverless

Serverless doesn't mean no sysadmins, even though there aren't instances to administer. We need to change common processes that we rely on to monitor and manage services that run on serverless platforms. There are not system level metrics to understand how our application is working.

Here are a few resources to help:

- [Building Observability Into a Serverless Application](https://vimeo.com/289905221) (Video) Yan Cui presents some guidelines to implementing observability into serverless on AWS. The patterns in this talk can be applied to other platforms as well.

### Source control

No matter what source control system you use (`git`, `hg`, `perforce`, whatever), you're going to have to write commit messages. Make them good. It may be obvious _today_ why you made the change, but in six months or a year you won't have that context.

- Explain _why_ you made the change, not just _what_ you changed. And no, the diff is not an explanation.
- Start your commit messages with a single line that explains what you were trying to do in general
- Go into more detail about your changes in the message body. Talk about what you intend the change to do and why more than how you did it. If there's an issue or ticket number, include that in your commit message too, it'll give more context to your coworkers (or you in a year).

Good commit messages help the rest of your team understand what you're trying to do and make it easier for them to find logic errors in your pull requests - the code may be technically correct, but if they understand what you're _trying_ to do, they can see when your code isn't actually doing what you say you want it to do, even when it is syntactically correct.

Here are a few articles that while focused on `git` commit messages apply to any source control system:

- [5 Useful Tips for a Better Commit Message](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message) is another good article on writing commit messages.
- [A Note About Git Commit Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
- [Writing Good Commit Messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) is a good article on writing coherent commit messages.

#### Git

Whether or not your shop uses `git` internally, you're going to end up needing to use it for the many useful tools and references hosted on GitHub and GitLab.

- [19 Git Tips for Everyday Use](http://www.alexkras.com/19-git-tips-for-everyday-use/) - a good set of starter tips for using `git`.
- [git-extra-commands](https://github.com/unixorn/git-extra-commands) - a misleadingly named collection of extra `git` helper scripts, blog posts, tutorials and videos.
- [git-flight-rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) is Kate Hudson's guide to using `git` in specific situations.
- [git-tips/tips](https://github.com/git-tips/tips) is a collection of `git` tips
- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub is a great overall resource for `git`.
- [Why the Heck is Git so Hard? The Places Model](http://merrigrove.blogspot.com/2014/02/why-heck-is-git-so-hard-places-model-ok.html) is an article about moving from SVN/CVS to `git`.
- Ben Limmer's [Git Skills Talk](https://github.com/blimmer/1up-git-skills-talk) will help you understand using `git` (particularly with GitHub).

### SSH

- [awesome-ssh](https://github.com/moul/awesome-ssh) - A curated list of `ssh` apps, libraries and other resources.
- [drduh Yubikey-Guide](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide) - A comprehensive guide to using Yubikey hardware tokens with SSH and GPG.
- [SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596008956.do)

### Testing

Testing is incredibly important and you should undertake this for your infrastructure as well as your applications.

#### Test Harnesses

- **Test Kitchen** [https://kitchen.ci](https://kitchen.ci) - Test your configuration management tooling. Test kitchen was originally written to test chef cookbooks, but can be used for other configuration management systems as well.

### Text Editors

Don't get involved in the Editor Wars.  Just.  Don't.  Your choice of tool does not need defending.  Nor does anyone else's choice.

However, you should care about your tools.  You should be able to use them efficiently.

#### Vim

`vim` is a reality of life for SysAdmins.  It is the one editor you can be sure is installed in even the most minimal *NIX or linux install. You must be able to do at least basic edits with it.  You don't need to love it, but eventually you _will_ have to use it.

- [Damian Conway, "More Instantly Better Vim" - OSCON 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHm36-na4-4)
- [vi and Vim Editors Pocket Reference, 2nd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010913.do)

#### Emacs

Emacs is an extremely extensible editor. In jest, it is frequently referred to as an operating system with a half-decent editor.

If you want to get a taste of what `emacs` can do, you can defer to Magnars and his excellent video tutorials/demos:

- [http://emacsrocks.com](http://emacsrocks.com/)

One of the biggest problems with `emacs` is that the defaults present a fairly different experience to what people are used to in other editors. Your first stop should be learning the basics using the built-in tutorial, followed by the mini-manual from tuhdo:

- Type `ctrl-h`, followed closely by `t` from within `emacs` to see the tutorial [http://tuhdo.github.io/index.html](http://tuhdo.github.io/index.html).

Emacs can be can be made to look and act relatively modern if that's your desire:

- [http://emacs.sexy/](http://emacs.sexy/)

If you're looking for `emacs` packages, the following online package index is the most popular, and tracks many of them:

- [http://melpa.org/](http://melpa.org/)

There are several excellent starter kits out there, with varying delineations of whiz-bang. Here are some starter kits, with spacemacs being the most popular:

- [bbatsov/prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
- [hlissner/doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)
- [syl20bnr/spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)
- [technomancy/better-defaults](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/better-defaults)

Here are some `emacs` configurations for inspiration:

- Magnar Sveen's very interesting and original `emacs` config! [magnars/.emacs.d](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d)
- Phil Hagelberg's config: [https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/dotfiles/tree/master/.emacs.d](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/dotfiles/tree/master/.emacs.d)
- Steve Purcell's excellent config: [purcell/emacs.d](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d)

#### Visual Editors and IDEs

Use tools which help you be productive.  If you want to use a GUI Text Editor or IDE, don't let anyone give you a hard time about that.

There are GUI versions of `vim` and `emacs` that have ardent followers.

- [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) is another editor with an extensive plugin ecosystem and arguably one of the inspirations for Atom.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a cross platform editor that is gaining traction in the community.

### Communication

Writing good documentation and design docs is as important as writing code. The more senior you are, the more writing you're going to have to do - communication skills are a must.

- Email - Like it or not, you're going to write a _lot_ of email in the course of your work. Make them good. Lazarus Lazaridis wrote a good article on [Composing Better Emails](https://iridakos.com/how-to/2019/06/26/composing-better-emails.html)

### Finance/Salary

- Patrick McKenzie wrote a great blog post on [salary negotiation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/). Salary negotiation is one of the few times in your life where a five minute conversation can earn you (or _cost_ you!) thousands of dollars - be prepared.
- Patrick also has a good podcast episode on salary negotiation - [Kalzumeus Podcast Episode 12: Salary Negotiation with Josh Doody](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2016/06/03/kalzumeus-podcast-episode-12-salary-negotiation-with-josh-doody/) (there's a transcript too). You have to do it, it affects your life, you should do it well.
- The [Fearless Salary Negotiation](https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com) site is a good read overall, especially the article on handling a [Salary Expectations Interview Question](https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/salary-expectations-interview-question/) when the recruiter asks. To quote them, "Your salary expectations are one of the few things you know that the company doesn’t. That makes them extremely valuable and sharing them can make your salary negotiations very difficult and even cost you a lot of money." so read (at least) this article before you start your next job interview cycle.
- [An Engineer's Guide to Stock Options](https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/an-engineers-guide-to-stock-options/) - Alex McCaw wrote a good blog post explaining stock options in plain English.

- [What I Wish I'd Known About Equity Before Joining A Unicorn](https://gist.github.com/yossorion/4965df74fd6da6cdc280ec57e83a202d) - This is an excellent (though USA-centric) summary of how to value stock options and what the tax implications are and how to minimize potential tax. I heartily recommend reading it before you accept any offers involving stock or stock options as part of your compensation.
